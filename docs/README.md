## Global Conference ‘Cooperatives for development’ 
### ICA

---

# Some Context

  - **For about a year now**, some co-ops in the federation have been working on a **strategy** that consists of **working "WITH" co-operatives**, building relationships based on trust to collaborate on technological projects. 

  - **Shortly after** considering this strategy, we began to think about **complementing it with another** that focuses more on who we work for. So we wanted to do more concrete actions in order **to work "FOR"** co-ops.

  - **ICA**: The International Co-operative Alliance, the global organisation that brings together all co-operative sectors.

---

# What did we go looking for?

  - **Continue working** on the **implementation of the IT Network**: The space proposed by the ICA to bring together cooperatives that have IT needs with IT solution providers.

  - **Work "FOR" co-ops**: The global co-operative sector runs its business using technology. This **technology** should be **produced by cooperatives**.

  - **Meet people** from other co-ops we wouldn't be able to meet in person if it wasn't during the event.

  - **To spread the word**: To communicate the message that **we work in collaboration** to achieve our goals.

  - **To generate links** with other co-ops that are open to the idea of working together.

---

# How did we collaborate to participate?

  - **Faced with** the current situation of **our economy**, if we wanted to travel to Africa to work on the proposed goals, **we had to join forces**. 

  - **All co-ops** in FACTTIC **contributed extra money** to the monthly fee to finance the trip.

  - More than **15 co-operators from 10 different co-operatives** also contributed **work** to produce: brochures, business cards and the **[FIT Landing Page](https://facttic.org.ar/fit/en)**.

  - We set up an articulated **communication strategy** between co-operatives, FACTTIC and the person in charge of communication at the ICA **to replicate the messages** reporting the event.

  - We set up a **[Diffusion Channel](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAE7bzC4NStkvudhhZg)** where we **communicated every day** the talks we attended at and the new links made.

---

# What did we find there?

  - **1.100 co-operators** from **94 different countries**.

  - A **broad overview** of the **cooperative sector**: From **co-operatives** and **small federations**, to **corporations** formed by many co-operatives.

  - **People** who were **surprised** to learn that there was a **co-operative sector** dedicated to the **production of technology**.

  - **Interest** in **collaborative** experiences between co-ops, in which many of us work as one to achieve a common goal.

  - **Interest** in the **tech co-ops network**: It positions us as a stronger actor with whom they can interact.

  - **The need to show** more of our **daily work**: Today there is not a **tech co-op actor** that **represents our sector** at an **international level**, so nobody heard of us.

  - **The need for technology** applied to cooperativism: **All cooperatives need** some technological solution and **we must be there** to develop it.

---

# What results did we get?

  - Participation in this event was helpful in **setting up** the **[FIT Landing Page](https://facttic.org.ar/fit/)**.

  - We managed to **build** one more **case of success** through **intercooperation**: All the content we decided to produce in order to participate was completed in time through **collaborative work**.

  - A lot of **enthusiasm!** When we saw **the willingness and surprise** of **other co-ops** to learn about the tech co-op sector.

  - More **knowledge**: We brought **information** about other interesting **co-operative processes** in other parts of the world.

  - Many **contacts**: We took advantage of participation to **talk to people, get to know each other** and discuss the possibility of **working together**.

# Conclusions

  - It was very **useful** for me to have been able to participate, to continue **to help in building** a model **based on collaboration between cooperatives**. 

  - We can take advantage of spaces like these **to continue creating cooperative links**.

  - We can continue **creating** our **own spaces** by **learning** from these kinds of experiences: What we **want to replicate** and what we **don't want to replicate**.
